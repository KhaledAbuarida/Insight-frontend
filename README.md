## About 
- this project is called "Insights" which refers to a data visualization and ML tool that helps the user explore cleaned data (we clean the dataset for the user) and explore it using a visual data grid table that shows the data in pagination.
- Users can upload and visualize a dataset with highly efficient and interactive charts that help them improve decision-making for their business benefits.
- [KhaledAbuarida](https://github.com/KhaledAbuarida) has the total ownership of Insights frontend including integrations with APIs
